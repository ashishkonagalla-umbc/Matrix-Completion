## How to Execute the Project

To run the project files, follow these steps:

### 1. Mount Google Drive
If you're using Google Colab or working with files stored in Google Drive, ensure you mount your Google Drive by adding the following lines at the start of your notebook:

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

### 2. Set the File Paths
Once Google Drive is mounted, update the file paths in the code to point to the correct locations in your drive. For example:

data_path = "/content/drive/MyDrive/YourProjectFolder/dataset.csv"
